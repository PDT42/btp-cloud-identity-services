# Enable Users to Recover Password with PIN Code

Users can choose to provide PIN code to reset their password.



<a name="loio046a2352009f45b9a87eb9dc7478a8df__prereq_vnp_bcg_ppb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

> ### Caution:  
> For security reasons, the PIN Code is not a recommended password recovery method. The users can follow the *Forgot Password* link on the sign in page to reset their password via email.

You can configure the applications in the tenant to allow users to provide PIN code to reset their password instead of receiving an email with a reset password link.

For this setup, you as a tenant administrator, configure the PIN code option in the *Tenant Settings* section in the administration console, and the users set their PIN code in the profile page.

Once the PIN code is configured, the user can use this option to reset the password. The user must have set their PIN code in the profile page to be able to reset password via this option.

If the PIN code option is configured in the admin console, end users that haven't set up their PIN code are triggered to do it as a post logon step. Optionally, they can choose to set up the PIN code later.

If end users choose the *Don't ask me again* check box, the prompt won't be shown anymore. End users still can set up the PIN code in their profile page.
