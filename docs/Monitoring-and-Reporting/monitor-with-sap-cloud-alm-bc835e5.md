<a name="loiobc835e53b13c4b4d885013a79a1294f4__section_xxv_cg1_ybc"/>

## Initial Configuration

You can request SAP Cloud ALM on [SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/) for yourself or for all entitled customers for whom you have sufficient permissions.

After you've requested SAP Cloud ALM, there are additional configuration steps that are required to set it up for productive use. For more information, see [Required Setup for SAP Cloud ALM](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/setup-administration/required-setup).

To use the apps, you must activate the data collection for the corresponding Managed Component:

-   in the *Configuration & Security Analysis* app. For more information, see [Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/csa-configuration).

-   in the *Job & Automation Monitoring* app. For more information, see [Job & Automation Monitoring Setup & Configuration](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/job-monitoring/job-automation-monitoring-details.html).

    > ### Note:  
    > To send job data to SAP Cloud ALM, you need a service of type *Identity Provisioning*.

## Configuration & Security Analysis

Via the *Configuration & Security Analysis* app of SAP Cloud ALM, you can check if your Identity ProvisioningSAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning tenant and provisioning systems are configured in alignment with the [Security recommendations for SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-security-recommendations-c8a9bb59fe624f0981efa0eff2497d7d/sap-btp-security-recommendations?version=Cloud).

## Job & Automation Monitoring

In the *Job & Automation Monitoring* app, you can experience a central job monitoring solution. You can monitor your jobs with metrics for their execution. The supported provisioning job types are *Read* \(immediate and scheduled\), *Resync* and *Simulate*. In the *Job & Automation Monitoring* app they are grouped by system name and jоb type. You have the option to drill down from a specific row to the list of executed jobs.

For more information, see [Job & Automation Monitoring](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/job-automation-monitoring?locale=en-US%20and%20https://support.sap.com/ja/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/job-monitoring.html) and the [relevant section on the SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/ja/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/job-monitoring.html).

In case you encounter problems with setting up or using the apps, you can create a case to the relevant component:
